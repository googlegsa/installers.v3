KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS:
-----------------------------------------------
1) Installer does not support '~' property while specifying dependency file locations.
2) Installer does not support '-' while entering connector instance name.

4) On Linux, installer does not display JDK/JRE on Choose JVM panel. On clicking Next, installer proceeds to next step even if no JRE/JDK is selected.
Suggested work-around: Click on "Choose another" button and select the required JDK/JRE or click on "Search for others" button to get a complete list of JDK/JRE installed on the machine and choose the required JDK/JRE.
5) JRE 1.6 is not displayed on "Choose JVM" Panel.
Suggested work-around: Click on "Choose another" button and select the required JDK/JRE or click on "Search for others" button to get a complete list of JDK/JRE installed on the machine and choose the required JDK/JRE.
6) On Linux, Test connectivity feature is available only in GUI mode and not in console mode.

8) On Linux, you need to be a root user to run the installer.
9)In case of Upgrade of FileNet 4.0 connector from 2.x to 2.6 or above, WSI option is not added to the service.bat (Windows) and catalina.sh (Linux).
	Suggested Workaround Steps for Service.bat (Windows):
	1. Append "-Dwasp.location=<SELECTED WSI FOLDER PATH>" in "%EXECUTABLE%" //US//, after "-Djava.util.logging.config.file" option.
	2. Go to the folder INSTALL_LOCATION/Tomcat/bin in command prompt.
	3. Run command "Service.bat uninstall" to uninstall the service.
	4. Run command "Service.bat install" to install the service.

	Suggested Workaround Steps for catalina.sh (Linux):
	1. Stop the connector service
	2. Append "-Dwasp.location=<SELECTED WSI FOLDER PATH>" after "JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms256m -Xmx1024m"

15) Connector Name entered on "Connector Configuration" panel remains unchanged if "Connector type" is changed by navigating "Next" and "Previous" to the "Select Connector" panel.
16) If CATALINA_HOME is already set in system's environment, then the installed connector service does not start.
17) On "Register Connector Manager with GSA" panel, if any error message occurs on clicking "Next", then clicking "Skip" button installer dis-appears. No summary panel will be displayed. For E.g.:
	a. Execute Google Connector Installer. Continue installation process till "Register Connector Manager with GSA" panel appears. Click Next button without entering any password.
	b. An error message is displayed that Password should not be left blank.
	c. Skip GSA registration by clicking Skip button.
