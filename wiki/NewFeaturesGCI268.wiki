#summary New Features supported in GCI 2.6.8 release

= Introduction =

This document walks through the installation process and features of Google Connector Installer 2.6.8 release


== 1. Installation of Google Search Appliance Connector for LDAP ==

This section describes the installation prerequisites and installation process for the Google Enterprise Connector for LDAP. 

You can install the connector using an installer that installs Apache Tomcat, a connector manager, and the connector. Google recommends that you use the installer unless you are building the connector manager or connector from the source code or you are installing a patch release that is not packaged with an installer. 

Installing the Connector Using the Installer

Before installing the connector using the installer, ensure that Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5 or 1.6 is installed on the host where you are installing the connector.

The instructions that follow are in two parts. In the first part, you download and uncompress the installer package. In the second, you install the software on the connector host.

The user running the installer must have the following user privileges on the connector host:

On Windows, the user must be an administrator.
On Linux, the user must have sufficient rights to execute the installer file. The user can be a root or nonroot user.
To download and uncompress the installation package:

1.Log in to the host using an account with sufficient privileges to install the software.

2.Start a web browser.

3.Navigate to the Downloads tab of this (Google Search appliance Connectors) site.

4.Download the correct software distribution package to the host where you are installing the software.

5.Unzip the package.

If you are on Windows, next step and go to the instructions immediately below for installing Tomcat, a connector manager, and the connector.

6.If you are on Linux, follow these instructions.
Open a terminal window and go to the base directory of the GCI.bin file in the extracted folder.

7.Give the GCI.bin file execute permission.

To run the installer in graphical mode, execute the following command:
./GCI.bin LAX_VM/java_location_to_java

For example, ./GCI.bin LAX_VM /usr/java/j2sdk1.5.2_15/bin/java

8. To run the installer in console mode, execute the command in Step 7 above with the -i console argument appended.

Go to the following instructions and proceed from Next step.

To install the connector and its supporting software:
