*Release 2.8, October 2011*
===========================

*INTRODUCTION*
------------
This is an early access release for wide evaluation and usage. Your feedback is important to us. Keep in mind that we are continuing to work on Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 2.8 (32-bit) and things may change in the future.

*Pre-requisites*
---------------
SharePoint 2007 (WSS 3.0, MOSS 2007) or SharePoint 2010 server.

Windows Server 2003 Enterprise server/Windows Server 2008 Enterprise server.

Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0.

IIS 6.0/IIS 7.0.

*Note:*
-----
If you have already installed Google Services for SharePoint or Google Search Box for SharePoint earlier using the old installer (i.e. GSS.msi or GSBI.msi or Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 1.x.x), please uninstall them before trying the Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 2.8 installer.

*Features*
---------
1. Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 2.8 (32-bit) installer bundles following components:

a) Google Search Box for SharePoint 2.6.10: It represents Google Search Box for SharePoint. When selected, the Google Search Box for SharePoint is enabled on all SharePoint web applications on a machine, which share the same search control.

b) Google Services for SharePoint 2.8: The Google Services for SharePoint are custom web services used by the Google Search Appliance Connector 2.8 for Microsoft SharePoint 2007 and Microsoft SharePoint 2010.

c) GSA Resource Kit for SharePoint: It represents the following utilities:

	-Google Search Box for SharePoint Test Utility : It is used to verify the Google Search Box for SharePoint parameters, cookies and headers. 
 
	-GSA Security SPI Simulator: It is used to test Google SAML Bridge for Windows without involving the complexity of the search appliance. Once you know that the SAML Bridge works, you can reconfigure it to work with the search appliance.

	-Google SAML Bridge for Windows 2.8: It enables Google Search Box for SharePoint to perform search on NTLM contents.
