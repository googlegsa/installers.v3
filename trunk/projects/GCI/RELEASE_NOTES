   Suggested Workaround Steps for catalina.sh (Linux):
     a. Stop the connector service
     b. Append "-Dwasp.location=<SELECTED WSI FOLDER PATH>" after "JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms256m 
     -Xmx1024m"
     c. Start the connector service.

    again, then GCI exits.
8. In GCI Console mode an extra "*" appears on "Register Connector Manager on GSA" panel.
9. After upgrade with 3.x over 2.0.x versions, older menus i.e. "Test Connector Manager 
    Connectivity" and "Test Google Search Appliance Connectivity" does not get deleted from Start 
    Menu for Windows and "Test_Connector_Manager_Connectivity" and 
    "Test_Google_Search_Appliance_Connectivity" does not get deleted from connector's home 
    directory for Linux.
10. Connector Name entered on "Connector Configuration" panel remains unchanged if "Connector type"
    is changed by navigating "Next" and "Previous" to the "Select Connector" panel.
11. If CATALINA_HOME is already set in system's environment, then the installed connector service
    does not start.
12. On "Register Connector Manager with GSA" panel, if any error message occurs on clicking "Next",
    then clicking "Skip" button installer dis-appears. No summary panel will be displayed. For E.g.:

    the last row. You need to re-browse and select the jar to get it enabled.
16. In Console/UI mode on Windows, after successful uninstallation of a connector, a message "Some 
    items could not be removed" is displayed. This is typically the case if more than one connector
    installations share the same shortcut folder
17. After upgrade over the lower versions, an update complete message does not contain the version 
    to which it is updated.  This is observed in GCI console mode.  Eg: "Congratulations!  Google 
    Connector (SharePoint1) has been successfully installed/updated to: 3.2.2"
18. The page to register LDAP connector not appearing after installing connector manager on LINUX.
19. While upgrading connector with another type of connector,  shortcut labels are not getting

    Folder> 3.2.6".
21. On Console , while upgrading the connector, from the Upgrade summary message if we go back to 
    select another JVM error message "Invalid JVM" is displayed.
